        "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/5": "I believe we are looking for the Dragonsworn Cloak, a truly excellent example of \"Dynweaving\" that imparted the cloth with incredible durability.",

        "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/6": "Legends say it could turn aside Espases, and even arrows couldn't pierce it.",
        "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/7": "However, at some point the cloak became a symbol of the leader of Mistria. As fashion sensibilities changed, well...",
